Based on the available information, the repository `avl-mod-1` by `ifazil1211` contains two Solidity files: `erc20.sol` and `vault.sol`. 

Here's a sample `README.md` file for the repository:

```markdown
# avl-mod-1

This repository contains Solidity smart contracts related to ERC-20 token implementation and a vault system.

## Files

- **erc20.sol**: This file contains the implementation of the ERC-20 token standard, which defines a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

- **vault.sol**: This file contains the implementation of a vault contract, which is typically used to store and manage tokens securely.

## Getting Started

To work with these smart contracts, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ifazil1211/avl-mod-1.git
   cd avl-mod-1
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Then, install [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g truffle
   ```

3. **Compile Contracts**:

   ```bash
   truffle compile
   ```

4. **Deploy Contracts**:

   Set up a local Ethereum blockchain using [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) or connect to a testnet/mainnet using appropriate configurations. Then, deploy the contracts:

   ```bash
   truffle migrate
   ```

## Usage

After deployment, you can interact with the contracts using Truffle console or any Ethereum wallet that supports contract interactions.
